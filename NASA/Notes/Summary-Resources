NASA Notes

Summary:
I have began a personal research project of in an attempt to gain experience on data
analysis. My work began with selecting a NASA software, which I located through searching
NASA software on Google. I found a software used for the analysis of the CMB (Cosmic
Microwave Background). From this I found that the software is run in Python. I have
dedicated a few weeks to learning the language and trying to decipher the software.
I used several methods to learn the Python, the main two being Code Academy and Linux
Command.org. Googling any question I have had was also vital for my understanding
of the new syntax. Now that I feel comfortable using Python I have started experimenting
with the code provided with the git repository connected to the NASA software.
Along side this, I have begun researching pasted projects that have dealt with CMB
all of which appears to be under the LAMBDA project. The website for LAMBDA
lists the CMB research project and provides the software if available. From this
the WMAP mission seems the most promising as it provides the software and reference
data as well as instructions for instillation. The WMAP personal website provides
further information as to project details and lists all involved in the program.
As I progress in my work I plan to reach out to some of the individuals on the list
to gain further insight on the use of the software. This has been all the progress
I have made before I started taking notes on my work. Going forward I should have
notes to better reflect my progress.
